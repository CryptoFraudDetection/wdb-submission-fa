# WDB Submission
Mini-Challenge by Florian Baumgartner & Aaron Br√ºlisauer

## Report
The report can be found in the file `report.pdf`.

## Code
The code can be found in the folder `main`. The folder `main` is a submodule that points to the correct commit on our challenge repository. You might need to run `git submodule update --init --recursive` to get the code.

## How to use this Repository
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `git submodule update --init --recursive` to get the code.
3. Navigate to the `main` folder and read its README file for further instructions on how to use the code.

## Branching Strategy
Features were developed in feature branches on the challenge repository. The feature branches were reviewed by a second person, optionally improved and finally merged into the `main` branch. The `main` branch was then used as a submodule in this repository.

## Issue Tracking
We used the issue tracker on the challenge repository to keep track of tasks and bugs. The issues were assigned to one or multiple team members. The [Taskboard](https://github.com/orgs/CryptoFraudDetection/projects/1) shows the overview of the project sprints. Discussions where documented in the [Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/CryptoFraudDetection/discussions) section of the challenge organization.

## Logging
Logging was implemented and can be enabled to a specific verbosity level. See also: `main/src/CryptoFraudDetection/utils/logger.py` which was used to log messages in the code.
